# Welcome

Welcome. This space will be focusing on topics such as Automation, PowerShell, Azure, AWS, Terraform and more. 

# YouTube Channel

Currently, you can check out my YouTube channel for an introductory lab on using Terraform with Microsoft Azure. It's geared towards beginners that may know a little about each technology but haven't fully jumped in.
